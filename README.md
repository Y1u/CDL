# CDL
Cheap Data Logger

 * Use a ILI9341 240 x 320 display to show temperature collected with 
 * Adafruit MAX31856 Universal Thermocouple Amplifier (K, J, N, R, S, T, E, or B type thermocouple)
 * Actually using Arduino Mega 2560
 * 2 simple 10 kOhm are used as controls to select the screen and the thermocouple.
 * In the present demo only one thermocouple is implemented: the CDL is easily modifiable
 * to show up to 7 different sensors
